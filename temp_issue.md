# Phase 1 Site Polishing - Master Tracking

This is the master tracking issue for Phase 1 site polishing. We'll work through each area sequentially while maintaining visibility of overall progress.

## Areas of Focus

- [ ] 1. **Component Structure Refinements**
    - Reorganize components to mirror React-like structure
    - Implement consistent naming conventions
    - Add JSDoc comments for future TypeScript migration

- [ ] 2. **Asset Optimizations**
    - Centralize asset organization
    - Optimize images and implement consistent naming
    - Set up proper file structure for media assets

- [ ] 3. **Documentation Improvements**
    - Update technical documentation
    - Add inline code comments
    - Improve setup instructions

- [ ] 4. **Performance Enhancements**
    - Optimize asset loading
    - Implement caching strategies
    - Improve page load times

- [ ] 5. **Code Consistency and Formatting**
    - Apply consistent coding style
    - Standardize file organization
    - Implement best practices

## Progress Tracking
- Each area will have its own dedicated issue linked to this one
- Areas will be worked on sequentially to maintain focus
- Check off areas as they are completed

# Component Migration Implementation

## Overview
Implementation of the component migration strategy as part of the Component Structure Refinements epic (#38).

## Parent Issues
- Parent Epic: Component Structure Refinements #38
- Strategy Document: [Safe Component Migration Strategy](../docs/planning/issues/component-migration-strategy.md)

## Implementation Tasks
### Phase 1: Directory Setup
- [ ] Set up `/components/layout` directory structure
- [ ] Set up `/components/common` directory structure
- [ ] Set up `/components/features` directory structure
- [ ] Set up `/components/pages` directory structure

### Phase 2: Component Migration
- [ ] Header Component
  - [ ] Create new component structure
  - [ ] Implement subcomponents (Navigation, MobileMenu)
  - [ ] Add tests
  - [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Footer Component
  - [ ] Create new component structure
  - [ ] Add tests
  - [ ] Update documentation

### Phase 3: Integration & Testing
- [ ] Implement component testing framework
- [ ] Add integration tests
- [ ] Verify zero-downtime migration
- [ ] Performance testing

## Technical Details
- Branch: `feature/component-migration`
- Migration Strategy: Safe parallel implementation
- Testing Framework: To be implemented

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All component directories properly structured
- [ ] Header and Footer components migrated
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] No regression in functionality
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Performance metrics maintained or improved

## Notes
- Following safe migration strategy
- Each step can be rolled back if needed
- Maintaining backward compatibility during migration
- Regular testing at each stage
