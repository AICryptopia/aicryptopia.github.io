# Common Components

## Purpose
This directory contains reusable UI components that are shared across multiple pages of the website. These components are designed to be modular, maintainable, and consistent with our design system.

## Directory Structure
```
common/
├── Button/         # Button components and variants
├── Card/           # Card components for content display
├── Form/           # Form elements and input components
├── Icons/          # SVG icons and icon components
└── README.md       # This documentation
```

## Usage Guidelines
1. Each component should be in its own directory
2. Include a README.md in each component directory
3. Follow the established naming conventions
4. Keep components small and focused
5. Document any dependencies

## Component Requirements
- Must be truly reusable (used in multiple places)
- Should be self-contained
- Must include documentation
- Should follow our design system
- Must be responsive

## Adding New Components
1. Create a new directory for your component
2. Add component files (HTML, CSS if needed)
3. Include a README.md with:
   - Purpose
   - Usage examples
   - Dependencies
   - Notes
4. Update this README.md if needed

## Current Components

## Notes
- Components will be added incrementally as needed
