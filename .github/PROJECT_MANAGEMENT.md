# AICryptopia Project Management Guide

## Project Views

We organize our work using three strategic views aligned with our pillars:

### 🔧 BUILD (Technical)
- Focus: Technical development and implementation
- Includes: Core features, bug fixes, technical improvements
- View Type: Board with status columns

### 💪 MOTIVATE (Community)
- Focus: Community engagement and interaction
- Includes: Community features, user feedback, engagement initiatives
- View Type: Board with status columns

### 🎯 PROMOTE (Marketing)
- Focus: Marketing and outreach
- Includes: Marketing campaigns, content creation, promotional activities
- View Type: Board with status columns

## Status Columns

Each view uses consistent status columns:

- 📋 **Backlog**: Tasks that are defined but not yet started
- 🚧 **In Progress**: Tasks actively being worked on
- 👀 **In Review**: Tasks undergoing review or testing
- ✅ **Done**: Completed tasks

## Label System

### Strategic Pillars
- `BUILD`: Technical development tasks and features
- `MOTIVATE`: Community engagement and interaction tasks
- `PROMOTE`: Marketing and outreach initiatives

### Priority Labels
- `🔥 Priority: High`: Urgent tasks requiring immediate attention
- `⏰ Priority: Medium`: Important tasks to be addressed soon
- `📅 Priority: Low`: Tasks that can be addressed when resources are available

### Type Labels
- `🐛 Type: Bug`: Something isn't working as expected
- `✨ Type: Feature`: New feature or enhancement request
- `📚 Type: Documentation`: Documentation additions or improvements
- `🔧 Type: Maintenance`: Repository maintenance, code refactoring, or optimization
- `🌱 Type: Good First Issue`: Good for newcomers and first-time contributors
- `🤝 Type: Help Wanted`: Extra attention is needed, community help welcome
- `❓ Type: Question`: Further information or clarification is requested

### Status Labels
- `⏸️ Status: Blocked`: Task is blocked by dependencies or issues
- `⌛ Status: Waiting`: Waiting for review or external input
- `🔄 Status: In Progress`: Task is actively being worked on
- `👀 Status: Review Needed`: Ready for review and feedback

## Best Practices

### Using Labels
1. Every issue should have at least:
   - One strategic pillar label (BUILD/MOTIVATE/PROMOTE)
   - One priority label
   - One type label

2. Status labels should be updated as the task progresses

### Using Project Views

2. Keep status columns up to date
3. Review and update task status regularly

### Creating Issues

2. Apply appropriate labels immediately
3. Add to the relevant project view
4. Provide clear descriptions and acceptance criteria

### Pull Requests
